# netflix-personalised-dashboard
"Netflix Personalised Dashboard" is a data-driven project analysing my Netflix viewing habits. It includes insights on viewing patterns, genre preferences, content ratings, and time spent watching. The project uses Python for data manipulation and visualisations, presented in a Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
