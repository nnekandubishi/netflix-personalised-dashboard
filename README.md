# netflix-personalised-dashboard
"Netflix Personalised Dashboard" is a data-driven project that provides insights into a user's Netflix viewing habits. This dashboard includes analyses of content types, genres, ratings, and binge-watching behaviour over time. Key features include time-based viewing trends, genre popularity fluctuations, content ratings analysis, and the average time spent on Netflix. The project uses Python for data manipulation, visualisations with libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly, and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for interactivity.
