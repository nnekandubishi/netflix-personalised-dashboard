# netflix-personalised-dashboard
Netflix-Personalised-Dashboard is a data-driven project that provides insights into my personal Netflix viewing habits. Netflix is a global streaming service offering a vast collection of films, documentaries, TV shows, and original content across various genres. With millions of users worldwide, Netflixâ€™s personalised recommendations and vast library make it an ideal source for data analysis.

This project leverages my own Netflix viewing history, specifically focusing on the dates when I watched various titles, to explore patterns, trends, and behaviours. It includes analyses of content types, genres, ratings, and viewing habits, aiming to understand how I interact with the platform.

**Key Features:**

**Time-based Analysis:** Visualise the types of content watched on different dates throughout the year, identifying patterns in seasonal or daily viewing habits.

**Genre Analysis:** Breakdown of which genres are most frequently watched, and how genre preferences shift over time.

**Ratings Analysis:** Examine the correlation between content ratings and genres to see if certain genres feature higher-rated content more frequently.

**Number of Shows Watched per Month:** Track the number of unique shows watched each month to observe overall viewing activity.

**Genre Popularity Over Time:** Analyse how genre preferences fluctuate across different periods, revealing long-term shifts in viewing habits.

The project uses Python for data manipulation and visualisation, utilising libraries like Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib/Seaborn for generating insights. Additionally, Tableau is used to create interactive dashboards, providing an intuitive way to explore the data and generate insights.

This analysis is presented in Jupyter Notebooks and enhanced with Tableau dashboards, combining both technical analysis and user-friendly visual exploration.
